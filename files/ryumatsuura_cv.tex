\schoolwithcourses{Harnessing Satellite Data to Improve Social Assistance Targeting in the Eastern Caribbean \textnormal{(with Sophia Chen, Flavien Moreau, and Joana Pereira)}}{}{\vspace{2mm} \textit{Abstract}: Prioritizing populations most in need of social assistance is an important policy decision. In the Eastern Caribbean, social assistance targeting is constrained by limited data and the need for rapid support in times of large economic and natural disaster shocks. We leverage recent advances in machine learning and satellite imagery processing to propose an implementable strategy in the face of these constraints. We show that local well-being can be predicted with high accuracy in the Eastern Caribbean region using satellite data and that such predictions can be used to improve targeting by reducing aggregation bias, better allocating resources across areas, and proxying for information difficult to verify. \vspace{2mm}}

\schoolwithcourses{Political Implications of Trade Liberalization: Evidence from India \textnormal{(with Sebastian J\"{a}vervall and Roza Khoban)}}{}{\vspace{2mm} \textit{Abstract}: In recent decades, many developing countries have integrated into the global economy through trade reforms. However, the gains from trade liberalization have been unevenly distributed among various economic and social groups. This paper examines how adverse economic shocks, induced by trade liberalization, influenced voting behavior and political representation among marginalized groups in India. By utilizing exogenous variation in regional exposure to tariff reductions from India’s 1990s trade liberalization and constructing a novel dataset that links politicians to social communities, we establish causal estimates of the economic and political effects of trade reforms. Our findings reveal that trade liberalization led to a relative decline in consumption and earnings growth for marginalized workers. In response, these groups increased their political engagement, resulting in higher vote shares and representation for marginalized politicians, while non-marginalized politicians experienced a corresponding decline. We show that these political effects were most pronounced in districts with a significant marginalized population share, suggesting a political backlash from marginalized groups. Furthermore, we provide evidence that a redistributive policy mitigated these political changes, thereby supporting the economic grievances hypothesis.}

\schoolwithcourses{Political (Mis)selection: The Role of Historical Institutions \textnormal{(with Shubhro Bhattacharya and Utsav Manjeer)}}{}{\vspace{2mm} \textit{Abstract}: Is there a persistent impact of historical institutions on the selection of ``bad'' politicians? In this paper, we document the nuanced consequences of history on modern adverse political selection using variations in colonial land tenure systems during British rule in India. Politicians with criminal charges are significantly more likely to run for office, and win elections, in areas where extractive landlords historically held substantial property rights. Corrupt politicians who experience disproportionately large private financial gains in office, however, are significantly more likely to be in areas where individual cultivators historically held property rights. Our analysis establishes that these estimates are not biased by endogeneity concerns. Rather, a plausible mechanism indicates a comparative advantage for criminal politicians in the conflictual electoral environment of landlord areas. The relatively less competitive elections in non-landlord areas, instead, are susceptible to elite capture and subsequent wealth accumulation via corporate connections by politicians.}
