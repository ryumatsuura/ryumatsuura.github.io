**Political Implications of Trade Liberalization: Evidence from India** (with Sebastian J&auml;vervall and Roza Khoban)

*Abstract*: In recent decades, many developing countries have integrated into the global economy through trade reforms. However, the gains from trade liberalization have been unevenly distributed among different economic and social groups. This paper examines how adverse economic shocks induced by trade liberalization influence voting behavior and political representation among marginalized groups in India. Using exogenous variation in regional exposure to tariff reductions from India's 1990s trade liberalization and constructing a novel dataset linking politicians to social communities, we establish the causal estimates of economic and political effects of trade reforms. Our findings reveal that trade liberalization led to a relative decline in consumption and earnings for workers from marginalized groups. In response, these groups increased their political engagement, resulting in higher vote shares and representation for politicians from marginalized groups, with a counteracting decline among non-marginalized group politicians. We show that these political effects are most pronounced in districts with a significant population share of marginalized groups, suggesting that economic grievances fueled the political backlash. Furthermore, we provide evidence that redistributive public policy mitigated these political changes, supporting the economic grievances hypothesis.
