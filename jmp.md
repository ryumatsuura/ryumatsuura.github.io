**Political Implications of Trade Liberalization: Evidence from India** (with Sebastian J&auml;vervall and Roza Khoban)

*Abstract*: In recent decades, many developing countries have integrated into the global economy through trade reforms. However, the gains from trade liberalization have been unevenly distributed among different economic and social groups. This paper examines how adverse economic shocks, induced by trade liberalization, influenced voting behavior and political representation among marginalized groups in India. Using exogenous variation in regional exposure to tariff reductions from India?s 1990s trade liberalization and constructing a novel dataset that links politicians to social communities, we establish causal estimates of the economic and political effects of trade reforms. Our findings reveal that trade liberalization caused a relative decline in consumption and earnings for marginalized workers. In response, these groups increased their political engagement, which resulted in higher vote shares and representation for marginalized politicians, while non-marginalized group politicians experienced a corresponding decline. We show that these political effects were most pronounced in districts with a significant population share of marginalized groups, suggesting that economic grievances fueled a political backlash. Furthermore, we provide evidence that a redistributive public policy mitigated these political changes, thereby supporting the economic grievances hypothesis.
