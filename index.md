<p>
I am a sixth-year economics PhD student at Northwestern University, currently on the 2024-25 job market. My research interest lies at the intersection of development economics and political economy.

<p>
I previously worked at <a href="http://www.devdatalab.org">Development Data Lab</a> as a research associate. I received my Bachelor's degree in Economics and Mathematical Science from Colby College in 2017.
